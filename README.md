## Hi  ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Sumaiyah**, a rising senior at Columbia University studying **Computer Science** and **Biology**, with a focus on applying computational methods to solve real-world problems in **medicine** and **public health**.

ðŸ§ª Iâ€™ve worked across academia and industry settings, using data to drive impact:

- ðŸ§¬ At **Mount Sinai**, I'm developing outbreak-tracking pipelines in **R** to map patient movement and trace bacterial transmission across hospital units.
- ðŸ¤– At **CUIMC**, I curated supervised training and validation sets for a predictive machine learning model in **Python** to predict protein-peptide interactions â€” helping accelerate therapeutic discovery.
- ðŸ›  At **OCME NYC**, I optimized backend systems for lab and forensic databases using **Java**, **C**, and **SQL** to improve data infrastructure for biological and legal workflows.

ðŸ”­ **Currently working on**:  
Computational projects in various fields of medicine, including **womenâ€™s health** and **cancer research**, applying ML and data science to better understand and inform medical decisions.

ðŸŒ± **Exploring**:  
Bioinformatics, neural networks, causal inference, and ML model deployment for real-world clinical and research applications

ðŸ‘¯ **Looking to collaborate on**:  
**Biotech, healthtech, and medtech** projects focused on improving patient outcomes, scientific discovery, and public health strategies
